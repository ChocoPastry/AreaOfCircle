# Euclidean Distance and Circle Area Calculator

This C program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points and then uses that distance to find the area of a circle.

## Usage

1. **Enter Point Coordinates**
    ```
    Enter x1: <x1>
    Enter y1: <y1>
    Enter x2: <x2>
    Enter y2: <y2>
    ```

Replace `<x1>`, `<y1>`, `<x2>`, and `<y2>` with the appropriate numeric values.

## Example

1. Calculate the area of a circle using the Euclidean distance between points (1, 2) and (3, 4):
    ```
    Enter x1: 1
    Enter y1: 2
    Enter x2: 3
    Enter y2: 4
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    15.700000
    ```

## Build and Run

To compile the program, use a C compiler such as GCC:
```bash
gcc euclidean_circle.c -o euclidean_circle
```

Run the compiled program and follow the prompts.
